1. This generation, characterized as digital natives, has expectations of deeply unique experiences. As people switch to proactive measures to improve their financial lives from saving to spending, we try to innovate a way to help make a budget, invest, and buy stocks and reimagine banking for Personal Finance Management.

2. When used correctly, business dashboards will help you make sense of your data and drive your business. However, not all dashboards are created equal. Many businesses make key mistakes with their dashboards, which can limit their effectiveness and kill the project altogether.

3. With the growing financial needs of the next generation, the consumers are rejecting complex services and old UI interfaces. Startups who focus on clean UI and User engagement techniques are taking over; still users are unable to get one tap solution to all their financial needs. They need to use different apps for stocks, banking, UPI and mutual funds!


At FINCRUX, we designed of an interactive banking dashboard which has different features for the next generation users:

1. One tap financial solutions: UPI, Passbook, Stocks, Insurance, business and budget management all would be available under one umbrella. The UI is clean, elegant and fast. It is developed for both desktop and smartphone users, a mobile application is also developed, it processes and delivers information without glitches and keeps the user engaged and satisfied.

2. The chatbot-coupled interactive feature allows you to pay bills, shop online, and transfer and pay through UPI . The main features of the UI is: It communicates information quickly, displays information clearly and efficiently, shows trends and changes in data over time, and it is easily customizable.

3. Spending overview and AI based stock recommendation system  gives you a graphical insight and helps optimize your actions- take loans, invest, or save.
